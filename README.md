## **📊 Performance Analysis**

### 1. **Time Complexity of Address Generation**
Generating a single Bitcoin address involves several cryptographic steps: private key generation, public key derivation, and address encoding. The time complexity for private key generation (which is the most computationally intensive part) is:

![Time Complexity Formula](https://quicklatex.com/latex3.f/quicklatex.com-0bcd1339354fa40a207c56f4a3b47d5c_l3.png)

Where `n = 2^256` represents the total number of possible private keys. The enormous size of this search space makes brute-forcing a private key infeasible.

For GPU-based systems, the time complexity reduces significantly as operations are parallelized:

```latex
T_{\text{GPU}} = O\left(\frac{\log(n)}{p}\right)
```

Where `p` represents the number of GPU cores. This reduction in time complexity enables ultra-fast address generation.

### 2. **Parallelization Efficiency**
Parallelization efficiency is crucial for ensuring the system is fully utilizing all available computational resources. The efficiency can be measured as:

```
E_p = T_address / T_parallel
```

Where `E_p` should approach 1 for perfect parallelism.

---

### 3. **Scalability and Resource Estimations**
Let's consider a high-end server with a **NVIDIA RTX 3090**:

- **Throughput**: \(5 \times 10^9\) addresses per second
- **Power Consumption**: 350W

#### **Time to Generate 1 Billion Addresses**:
For 1 billion addresses, the estimated time is:

```
T_billion = (10^9) / (5 × 10^9) = 0.2 seconds
```

#### **Total Power Consumption**:
The power used for 1 billion addresses would be:

```
P_total = 350W × (10^9 / 5 × 10^9) = 70W
```
